# Columbia University GSAS QMSS Data Visualization 
## Getting to Know Shiny package
### Billboard Charts

Included with the .Rmd and Data files, is an [html file](https://github.com/AdrianVQMSS/Data-Projects/blob/main/Billboard%20Charts/Billboard_Shiny.html)  "Billboard_Shiny.html". This file is not interactive so it doesn't serve to demonstrate the Shiny App functionality, but serves as a visual reference for the reader for what to expect when running the chunks that call the Shiny App functionality.
