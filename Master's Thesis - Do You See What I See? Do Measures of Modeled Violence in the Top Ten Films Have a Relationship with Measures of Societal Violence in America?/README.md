# Columbia University GSAS QMSS Master's Thesis

Master Thesis examined the relationship between rates of modeled violence/gun violence in the top ten films from 1961 to 2021 and rates of violence/gun violence in American Society.

•	Conducted web scraping, utilized the Open Movie Database API, and coded violence and firearm usage in 610 movies (the top ten films from 1960 to 2021)  
•	Conducted a comprehensive literature review on culture, violence, and cultural products  
•	Created data visualizations and performed statistical analyses for three sub-studies using multiple gun violence/mortality datasets  
•	While statistical significance was not achieved, the study highlights that certain violence measures in the top ten movies are increasing annually, paralleling the rising rates of real-world violence  

### IMPORTANT NOTE:   
1 dataset, from the Uniform Crime Report, was too large of a file to upload, even after compression. The zip file was still 298.5 MB after compression. Unfortunately, this data set couldn't be uploaded to the repository.
