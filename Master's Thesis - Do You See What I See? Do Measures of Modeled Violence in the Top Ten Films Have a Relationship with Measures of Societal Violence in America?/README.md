# Columbia University GSAS QMSS Master's Thesis

Master Thesis (PDF included in repo) examined the relationship between rates of modeled violence/gun violence in the top ten films from 1961 to 2021 and rates of violence/gun violence in American Society.

•	Conducted web scraping, utilized the Open Movie Database API, and coded violence and firearm usage in 610 movies (the top ten films from 1960 to 2021)  
•	Conducted a comprehensive literature review on culture, violence, and cultural products  
•	Created data visualizations and performed statistical analyses for three sub-studies using multiple gun violence/mortality datasets  
•	While statistical significance was not achieved, the study highlights that certain violence measures in the top ten movies are increasing annually, paralleling the rising rates of real-world violence  

### IMPORTANT NOTE:   
One dataset, from the Uniform Crime Report, was too large of a file to upload; even after compression, the zip file was still 298.5 MB. Unfortunately, this data set couldn't be uploaded to the repository. Please note the UCR .Rmd file will return an error for lack of the relevant .tsv file.
